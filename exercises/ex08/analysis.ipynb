    "Reflect on your personal experiences and observations in COMP110 and **brainstorm modifications to the course that _create value_ beyond its current design**. When brainstorming, try not to be critical of the ideas you come up with regarding scale, stakeholders impacted, or for any other reasons. In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",

    "3. The course should exclude the writing portions on the reading assignment to ease the workload of the instructional staff.\n",
    "4. The course should introduce a practical project contributed by the entire classroom that could seek to solve a problem that UNC currently faces. That mentioned earlier would, in turn, benefit the academic institution and the societal workforceâ€”by equipping the students with real-world experience.\n",
